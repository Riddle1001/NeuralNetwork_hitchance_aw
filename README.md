# Install directions

Download NodeJS LTS https://nodejs.org/en/

After downloading NodeJS open CMD and type "npm install brain.js".

Then download net.js from this github, above

After you've downloaded net.js, open the net.js file with a text editor

You will see a string like this

`C:\\Users\\Owner\\AppData\\Roaming\\EiuNDcMuKwIRKrPXEsTrJreP\\vFYfAogessHCds`

This is my aimware directory, change it to yours but keep the ending "`mapped_data.txt`"

After you have done that download the mapped_data.txt file and place it into your aimware folder

Now in the command line cd to the net.js file and type node net.js. This will run the neural network and train it.

While the neural network is training, download the accuracy.lua file

Run the accuracy.lua in aimware
